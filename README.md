# üåê Worldthoughts API

A simple and friendly real-time polling application.

- Users can discover random polls by pressing the "random question" button and vote on each.
- Afterwards, results will be displayed to the user and update in real-time.
- Pressing the "resubmit" button will allow the user to change their vote.
- Users can go to the *create* page and submit their own questions to the site.
